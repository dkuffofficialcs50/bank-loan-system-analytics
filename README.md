In this study, a dataset of customer information from banks and credit lenders was classified and predicted using four supervised learning techniques. However, before using the data set, all Identifiers were eliminated. I used the four main supervised learning approaches for this analysis, which are as follows:

Discriminant analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression

R Studio was used to perform each of these procedures, and the provided data set is called CREDIT 14. There is a powerpoint presentation of the findings in this repository.
